# DeliverrChallenge

This submission is composed of 3 classes

- `Warehouse` represents a warehouse possessing a name and inventory of items. This class is used to represent both existing warehouses and what is included in each shipment.

- `InventoryAllocator` holds the logic to finding the cheapest possible shipment given an order and a list of warehouses to ship from.

- `InventoryAllocatorTest` contains 10 test cases to cover various shipment scenarios: valid orders, invalid orders, splitting across warehouses, not enough inventory, etc.
